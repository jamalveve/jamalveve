### ðŸŽ¯ My Focus Areas

* **AI-Enhanced Development & Automation**
  Continuously integrating AI tools (ChatGPT, Gemini, LangChain) into workflowsâ€”for smarter development, code generation, data pipelines, and feature engineering

* **Data & SQL for AI Workflows**
  Applying SQL best practices to build clean, AI-ready datasetsâ€”whether itâ€™s querying Sakila, aggregating logs, or preparing ML features

* **Full-Stack System Thinking**
  Connecting user experience with back-end logic and dataâ€”ensuring every part of the stack contributes to scalable, maintainable products
